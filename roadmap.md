5. each user has its own unique colour scheme, selectable from the accent colours of the website's theme (twenty-twenty five). This changes the colour of the buttons, text and everything they see for their cupons (but keeps the other users coupon content with the other users colour so they remain distinct). They can change this colour from the preferences.
7. dashboard shortcode that shows quick stats, such as the latest cupon posted redeem, how many cupons they have posted and are avaliable, how many they have avaliable to them, etc, shows their name, profile picture, option to logoff, send feedback, to be included in the header of the website as the header of the app. Have that include the menu buttons (have the plugin figure out the urls for the pages where each shortcode is and then store that and use it moving foward).
8. add shorcuts to PWA
9. make the wordpress user bar dissapear from the top of the app
10. change colour of status bar while in the WPA on android.
11. make all buttons consistent with wordpress twenty-twenty five buttons with a 15px border radius.
12. enforce login in all pages with shortcodes.
