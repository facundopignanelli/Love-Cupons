2. in-website interface to post new coupons (title, terms and conditions, hero image (with an enforced aspect ratio check of 16:9 and maybe having the app prompt the user to crop the image accordingly), schedule coupons to show starting a certain date, expiration date and the number of times they can be redeemed). 
3. login redirect
4. Push notifications instead of email ones for redepmtion
5. each user has its own unique colour scheme, selectable from the accent colours of the website. This changes the colour of the buttons and everything they see for their cupons (but keeps the other users coupon content with the other uses colour so they remain distinct)
6. settings section where a user can select their colour, change to whom they post coupons, and maybe change profile picture if that's used anywhere in the ui?
7. dashboard section that shows quick stats, such as the latest cupon posted redeem, how many cupons they have posted and are avaliable, how many they have avaliable to them, etc. 
8. add shorcuts to PWA
